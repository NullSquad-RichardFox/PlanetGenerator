Planet Generator is a program that can procedurally generate a terrestrial planet or a gas giant and export it as a .obj 3D object. The program was created a part of my closing thesis at [Student Trainee Center Microsoft](https://stcmicrosoft.sk).

To generate project files:
1. clone the repository recursively
2. run an apropriate batch file from the 'Scripts/' directory.
